# RefinedStorage Viewer

## Setup

Setting everything up is relatively simple. There are three steps:

### 1. Running the server

```
git clone https://github.com/SarahIsWeird/RSViewer.git
cd RSViewer/webserver
npm install
npm start
```

### 2. Running the data provider

Requirements for the computer:
- Tier 2 or up
- Has an Internet Card
- Has a Lua BIOS
- Capable of running wget (OpenOS or any other operating system)
- For large RS systems, I recommend two Tier 3.5 RAM sticks.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SarahIsWeird/RSViewer/master/provider/provider.lua
provider.lua
```

### 3. Running the Android app

Check out the [Releases](https://github.com/SarahIsWeird/RSViewer/releases) page and download the latest APK. Transfer it to your phone and install it. That's it! (TODO: Set the server)
